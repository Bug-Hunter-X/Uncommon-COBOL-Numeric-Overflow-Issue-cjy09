This repository demonstrates a subtle numeric overflow bug in COBOL.  The program uses PIC 9(5) to declare variables, but doesn't explicitly handle the case when the counter exceeds 99999. Depending on the COBOL compiler and runtime environment, the behavior could range from silently wrapping around to unpredictable results.  The solution demonstrates how to handle potential overflows more robustly.
